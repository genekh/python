This directory contains python script for benchmarking the performance of
numba.

Running the benchmark
-----------------------

    python runall.py


Adding new bencharmk
---------------------

The "runall.py" will discover scripts if name prefix "bm_".  Each benchmark
script should contains two no-argument functions: "python_main" and
"numba_main".  They represent the entry point for the benchmark for python
code and numba code, respectively.  The timing is produced by `numba.utils
.benchmark`.  The best time is reported and it is normalized against the
python timing.
