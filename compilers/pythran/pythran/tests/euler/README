The only sensible modification is that they have been turned into function with no parameters returning a value instead of printing something.
Special cases are listed below:

euler07: manual import prime expansion
euler11: manual tuple to list conversion
euler12: manual import prime expansion
euler18: manual tuple to list conversion
euler27: manual import prime expansion
euler31: manual tuple to list conversion
euler32: manual import combinatorics expansion
euler34: manual tuple to list conversion
euler38: turn polymorphic variable into monomorphic variable
euler47: when importing factros from prime, rename it as prime_factor to prevent name clashing
euler55: turn polymorphic variable into monomorphic variable
