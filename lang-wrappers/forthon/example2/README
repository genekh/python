**** THIS EXAMPLE IS BROKEN AND DOES NOT WORK ****
It is saved for legacy purposes.

This contains an example which shows the use of Forthon in cases where the
fortran90 modules already exist and fortran derived types are being used. If
no derived types are being used, the original fortran should be able to be
used without change.

Note that currently, the definition of the derived type must be in its own
module with the name of the form TTTmodule, where TTT is the name of the
derived type. This is the module name assumed by Forthon.
